# Brand Voice Guidelines

## Knowledgeable Yet Approachable

### Principle
Use relatable analogies and metaphors for technical clarity.

### Examples

#### For Architects
"Think of our systems as the foundation of your design—just like a strong building base, they ensure every BIM project stands tall."

#### For Engineers
"Your workstation is your lab bench; we configure it to handle the precision and complexity of CFD and FEA simulations effortlessly."

#### For VFX Studios
"Your render pipeline is like a cinematic orchestra—our systems are the conductor, ensuring each component works in harmony."

## Proud and Personable

### Examples

#### For Architects
"Built for the rigors of BIM, not the needs of everyday users."

#### For Engineers
"Simulation-ready power that meets your project demands without compromise."

#### For VFX Studios
"VFX workflows demand creativity; your hardware shouldn't limit it."
